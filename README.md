# Water Shader For Unity

**Remaining Tasks -**

* Underwater surface shader to be improved
* Underwater Post-processing shader
* Physical forces on objects on the water

This waves are done by the vertex displacements of a plane mesh. The reflections, refraction, underwater scenes are done with shaders. And does not implement any position based fluids simulation i.e any particle simulation algorithm. So, this package does not have physical water interactions with other colliders.
